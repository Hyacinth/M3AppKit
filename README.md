- Alerts with block based callbacks
- Handling of table/outline view column visibility

- Accessory view management
- A navigation view (see the Lighthouse Keeper sidebar for an example)
- An equation based constraint syntax (e.g. $view1.left = $view2.right + 20)

- Improved subview ordering (including a block based subview sort) on NSView

And more
